# WebDesignPrototype


NOTE: files included in this repository were originaly a part of an university assignment. 
This website is just a prototype, there is no real functionality implemented. 


This prototype was created in order to explore good practices for creating user interfaces and overall design of a website. 
What I aimed for is a minimalistic design that will make using the website a pleasant experience. 

Bright colour palette and simple shapes give a feeling of cleanliness and accessibility there is no unnecessary graphical flare
that could confuse the user. This design is especially convenient for mobile device users as even when scaled down it stays 
clear and readable. 

Twitter Bootstrap API was used in order to ensure that all elements are actively responding to the size of the screen.
